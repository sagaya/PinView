## About

This project gives you a passcode control that can be dropped into any iOS app. It behaves exactly like the passcode screens that can be seen by going to Settings > General > Passcode Lock.

## Features

- Native iOS look and feel
- Masks pin entry with bullet characters (If you want a secured entry)
- Easily customizable 
- Provide custom text to be displayed on the passcode entry view
- Block-based passcode verification


## Installation

PinView is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'PinEntryField'
```
### Manual Installation
```
Drag the PinView file into your project and voil√†
```

## Create a new passcode
```swift
import PinView
```
Create the view inside `viewDidLoad`

```swift
let passcodeView = CodeView(numberOfPin: 4, codeStyle: .line)
passcodeView.isSecureTextEntry = true
//Conform to the protocol `PinInputDelegate` so you will know when the pin entery has been completed
passcodeView.delegate = self
passcodeView.frame = ??
//Yea that is all you have to do!!
```
The only extra protcol stub is 

```swift
func didFinishInput(_ inputView: CodeView, didFinishWith text: String) {
    print(text)
}
```
